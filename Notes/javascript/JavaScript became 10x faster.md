## **The JavaScript Hack No One Talks About**

**[Converting values to a string in JavaScript](https://2ality.com/2025/04/stringification-javascript.html?ref=hackernoon.com)** #string #conversion might sound like a small task, but it is surely very complicated. Here's the developer lifesaver you didn't know you needed!

  

**The Problem:**

- Most string conversion methods fail on symbols and null-prototype objects
- Different approaches crash on different types
- Your code randomly explodes with certain values

  

**The Solution:**

- Object.prototype.toString.call(value) handles everything perfectly
- Works with symbols, null-prototypes, and all edge cases
- It's like having a universal translator for JavaScript values
